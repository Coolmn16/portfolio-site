## About

> Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me! I'm Cole, a computer scientist based in Council Bluffs, IA who has a passion for games and a love for the internet. Armed only with 1-2 year old student projects and a 2 year game development internship, I'm finally heading out into the world to find this coveted "job experience" needed to acquire myself a job. 

I am a recent gradute from Iowa State University with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Classical Studies. I joined the Iowa State Game Development Club in 2016, of which I was VP in 2017 and Treasurer in 2020. During this time, I both learned and taught the tools of the trade for budding young game developers through hands-on workshops, lectures, and game jams. 

Although my passions lie with game development, my skillset is still viable for any who are seeking a dedicated and creative mind to add to their workforce.
