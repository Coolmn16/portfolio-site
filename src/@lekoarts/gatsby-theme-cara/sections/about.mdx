## About

> Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me! I'm Cole, a computer scientist based in Council Bluffs, IA, who has a passion for games and a love for the digital. I'm excited to head out into the world to make my mark— and to help you make yours. 

I am a recent graduate from Iowa State University with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Classical Studies. I joined the Iowa State Game Development Club in 2016, of which I was VP in 2017 and Treasurer in 2020. I have lectured students in game design and computer principles, as well as organized several Game Jams— competitions with a tight deadline in which programmers try to create a game as quick as possible.
