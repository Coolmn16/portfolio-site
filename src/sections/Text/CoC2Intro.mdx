## The Project

> Corruption of Champions II is an (18+) Text based RPG that is currently in early access on Steam. As a gameplay programmer for Salamander Stugio for this title, it has been my responsibility to take the content produced by our writers and realize it within the custom engine built by the lead programmer. 


##### Some examples of what I've implemented for CoC2 include: 
- Hawkthorne Gym
- Pupperidge Farm Jobs
- Act 2 of Winter Wolf (Including the Ship Dungeon)
- Rune, the Catfolk Temple Worshipper
- Maria, the Mushroom Druid
- Atugia's alternative introduction
- Lyla, the Wandering Dom
